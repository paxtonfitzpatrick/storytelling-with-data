This analysis looked at trends in how people of different religions feel comfortable:
 * (1) telling people they'll pray for them
 * (2) asking about
 * (3) bringing up religion unprompted. 
The original survey contained a number of questions and many answers were in the form of ordinal data. After cleaning up the data and converting it to numerical equivalents, I created a section of three bar plots looking at the frequency of 1, 2, and 3. In addition, I created a visualization of the data colored by Household Income and looked at an array of high income individuals.

The survey covers numerous questions related to a person's religious behaviors and attitudes, as well as demographic data.

##Running the code 

Run the cells sequentially in aly_berger.ipynb. Assuming nothing has been changed and `religion-survey-results.csv` is in the same folder as `aly_berger.ipynb`, there is nothing else needed for running the code.

Sources of inspiration are noted throughout the cells right above the inspired code. Although I selected for a small portion of the original survey, one could examine different questions or different attitudes by not dropping those relevant columns. Additionally, more complex demographic analyses could be performed to obtain a better understanding of the key characteristics influencing religious behaviors and attitudes.
